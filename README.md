# README

Basic docker image to build platformio / arduino projects.

Thought to be used via pipelines in Jenkins.

To build, install:

```
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
```

Then launch (don't forget the sudo):

```
sudo ./build
```

(you will need an account at `docker.com` to publish your image).
